# Java-Bank

Final Bootcamp exercise, building a bank application, respecting the conventions and good programming practices.

A new layer was added at each step so that the entire application would be in accordance with the MVC model.
I also learned how to persist data using MySql (one step with JDBC and the other with JPA)
